        Connected but isolated right? Of course! That is the slogan for our digital world which operate in a networked environment but tend to isolate its users as the barrier of space and time is removed. However, underneath this digital world is the software powering the connected systems. These software systems never operate in isolation but interact with other systems and hardware. Hence an improvement in an hardware or external software system would mean a significant improvement in the capabilities of existing software system infrastructure.<br/><br/>

To meet up and scale with the constant change, upgrade or improvement in hardware and external systems, the premise aforementioned could translate to two actions viz:<br/><br/>

-the optimization and adjustment of existing software systems and infrastructure to meet up with these changes,<br/><br/>

-the re-modelling and re-writing of systems' architecture and core to work effectively on improved hardware and connected systems.<br/><br/>

We focus on the second argument.

Most existing legacy software systems were written for single core hardware and a synchronous API systems of blocking I/O. Hence, as one process finishes, the other begins in a step by step manner up to the vary last command. While this might be sufficient for hardware and systems built in 70's and 80's(oops! I feel young right now...no offence to the old timers!) , it is however highly ineffective and inefficient to build software using such approach in modern times.<br/><br/>

First, the requirement for most systems has changed. No one wants to wait for software to hang up, only to display error after a long period of time. Everyone I know wants to perform more than one operation per time on a software system. Billions of traffics are hitting modern web software infrastructure and the demand for speed is staggering!<br/><br/>

Hence, in recent times, the role of software developers have shifted from just building software systems to building systems that are fast, reliable, fault-tolerant and concurrent (or parallel and asynchronous as the case may be), and does not fight with hardware i.e. utilizes and integrate seamlessly with host hardware and connected systems.<br/><br/>

The JVM comes with handy solutions and plethora of alternatives when it comes to building such modern aroused systems. Java, being not only a language but a platform effectively gives the engineer the plethora of choice when it comes to building such resilient and scalable systems that efficiently maximizes devices' resources. The army of JVM languages and technologies that best suite this condition include -<br/><br/>

(1) Java's Threading, Executors and Future approach<br/><br/>

(2) Groovy's Actors, Tasks/Promises, DataFlow (Operator/Selector), Agent and Channels<br/><br/>

(3) Scala’s AKKA toolkit with its erlang style, message passing architecture.<br/><br/>

(4) Kotlin’s co-routine<br/><br/>

While Java’s style is useful for most basic concurrent tasks, it is feasible to use the solutions provided by other JVM languages in large systems that could scale in order to prevent “Deadlock” and “race” conditions. Scala AKKA has already been battle-tested and is used in production. Groovy Gpars is also used in some java sub-systems of many java shops.<br/><br/>

In the ensuing sequel, I will be explicating on the various approaches offered by these JVM technology stacks to build modern concurrent (sometimes parallel/asynchronous), fault tolerant and scalable systems. Stay tuned!

      <h3><b>Is PHP programming language fading away?</b></h3>
     <span class="w3-opacity">Febraury 14, 2021</span>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container w3-padding w3-margin w3-card-4 w3-border w3-round-xxlarge">
      <p>PHP has come a long way from what it used to be!<br/><br/> As a polyglot programmer, I can say that PHP has matured in recent years. Although all languages have their pros and cons, the introduction of JIT compiler (part of what makes Java/JVM very fast)together with the already existing OP-Cache in PHP-8 has really made the system robust for production in enterprise.<br/><br/>
However, PHP is not the go-to language for building highly concurrent/parallel computing  systems as there are no built in support for this use case. Example is seen in scenarios like C10k - where a system can have 10,000 and even more requests hitting it at the same time. The system could become hung up, extremely slow or crash. <br/><br/>
Also, for asynchronous and real time systems, PHP support is poor. This includes concepts and protocols like Web socket, Comet, SSR and other reactive real time protocols. For this, the API has to be non-blocking and the architecture reactive(to events). <br/><br/>
Nevertheless, PHP community is trying to resolve some of this issues - there are PHP libraries and toolkits that  tries hard at this - Swoole-PHP and PHP-React are but a few, although they aren't quite matured yet. <br/><br/>
At the infrastructure level however, adding server modules/toolkits like load balancers, cache/message brokers like Redis, Micro-service architecture with individual runtimes , etc - could help speed up things on the server in this case, but that would mean more maintenance requirements/infrastructure pile-up, which could make the system become complicated.<br/><br/>

So, is PHP fading away? If you ask me, I will say NO! PHP is not going anywhere, it just has to be applied in areas of its greatest strength. PHP has really evolved from what it used to be. Its OOP syntax is very solid, it is partially compiled now with JIT compiler and capable of building large enterprise systems, with frameworks like Symphony and Laravel/Lumen to prove that. However, it might be out of place in some software domain as aforementioned.
